November 4th

Some sort of error in sessions, I think, when we have a lot of load. The error has such a long trace
that the log deletes the top of it, so I don't know where it starts

Load test of 25 simultaneous users over 15 seconds, get this error at some point.

ActiveRecord::ConnectionTimeoutError - could not obtain a connection from the pool within 5.000 seconds
 (waited 5.000 seconds); all pooled connections were in use

 After running some load tests, checked instrumentation logs
Tweet searching is taking up most of our time

Notes: Should make accessing the front page feed a cache operation, this has a lot to do with expensive db calls
This was after a lot of changes to caching. The front feed is now cached, but tweets are stored in feeds as integers, rather than their text as they used to be.
This decreased the amount of cached space used and increased our cache capacity, but decreased the speed of cache retrieval

This is a test for the /front page, which does not check for authentication

AFter around 690 simultaneous clients, the site seems to reach its limit and everyone is timing out after 10 seconds
Note: loader.io's interface keeps freezing while testing on my laptop. and it seems to happen around the time we have issues.
Wonder if there is a causal relationship somewhere

I Think that maybe some of this can be fixed by, rather than compressing the information stored in the whatever,

Why are we storing each and every tweet?
