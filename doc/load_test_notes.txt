Some sort of error in sessions, I think, when we have a lot of load. The error has such a long trace
that the log deletes the top of it, so I don't know where it starts

Load test of 25 simultaneous users over 15 seconds, get this error at some point.

ActiveRecord::ConnectionTimeoutError - could not obtain a connection from the pool within 5.000 seconds
 (waited 5.000 seconds); all pooled connections were in use

 After running some load tests, checked instrumentation logs
Tweet searching is taking up most of our time
